======
I hold a Bachelor in Economics from the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos  and have taken master courses at the Universidad del Rosario

I am a Research Analyst at Innovations for Poverty Action where I have been supporting projects in topics as venezuelan migration, microcredit and education. My previous job was at the Impact Evaluation Office of the Ministry of Housing, Construction and Sanitation. 

I have also developed a portfolio of open source projects (R and Python) as useful resources for the state, academia and students.

My research interests are applied microeconomics, development economics, and data science.
