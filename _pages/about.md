I hold a Bachelor in Economics at [Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos](https://unmsm.edu.pe/) and have taken master courses at [Universidad del Rosario](https://urosario.edu.co/)

I am a Research Analyst at [Innovations for Poverty Action](https://poverty-action.org/) where I have been supporting projects in topics as venezuelan migration, microcredit and education. In addition, I am a Research Assistant at the [Health Innovation Laboratory](https://www.innovalab.info/) conducting research on health economics. My previous job was at the Impact Evaluation Office of the [Ministry of Housing, Construction and Sanitation](https://www.gob.pe/institucion/vivienda/colecciones/1995-oficina-general-de-monitoreo-y-evaluacion-del-impacto-ogmei)

My research interests are applied microeconomics, development economics, and data science.

<!--I created a collection of open source projects (using R and #Python) that could be valuable resources for academics, #students and government.
