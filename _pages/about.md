I hold a Bachelor in Economics from the [Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos](https://unmsm.edu.pe/) and have taken master courses at the [Universidad del Rosario](https://urosario.edu.co/)

I am a Research Analyst at [Innovations for Poverty Action](https://poverty-action.org/) where I have been supporting projects in topics as venezuelan migration, microcredit and education. My previous job was at the Impact Evaluation Office of the [Ministry of Housing, Construction and Sanitation](https://www.gob.pe/institucion/vivienda/colecciones/1995-oficina-general-de-monitoreo-y-evaluacion-del-impacto-ogmei). 

I have also developed a portfolio of open source projects (R and Python) as useful resources for the state, academia and students.

My research interests are applied microeconomics, development economics, and data science.
